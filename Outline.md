### Outline
1. Guiding Questions
    - What makes a program "intelligent"?
    - How should we store movie data?
    - How can we define movie similarity?
    - How do we define a good recommendation?
    - Digging deeper:
        - KNN algorithm
        - Time-efficient approximations
            - Sampling
                - Follow-up: modified bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
        - Space-efficient approximations
            - Lower-dimension vector embeddings
